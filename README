Client API

Entirely escape-sequence based. Works with every programming language
which can write bytes to stdout. See ``support/schirmclient.py``.

Missing Features/Defects
========================

- Application mode (fullscreen ncurses apps use this) is not implemented properly.
- History is unbounded, you may have to restart schirm to get rid of old output/frames.
- Slower than any other terminal emulator, becomes slower with each page of terminal output.
- Expect more bugs than say xterm.
- Not configurable.
